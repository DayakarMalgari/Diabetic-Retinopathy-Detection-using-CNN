Kaggle Retinopathy Dataset Details: 

The dataset contains a large set of high-resolution retina images taken under a variety of 
imaging conditions. A left and right field is provided for every subject. Images are labeled 
with a subject id as well as either left or right. A clinician has rated the presence of diabetic 
retinopathy in each image on a scale of 0 to 4. Like any real-world dataset, there is  
noise in both the images and labels. Images have artifacts, out of focus, underexposed, 
or overexposed. The dataset is huge in Gigabytes and couldn't upload to github. Can be downloaded from kaggle 
if required.
